## Task 1: Identify a few redundant tests that can be removed

With the exception of primary keys, removed redundant tests in staging tables that already exist on source tables.

Updated this standard in the project README.

## Task 2: Write a custom generic test to replace a redundant singular test

Added custom generic test [here](https://github.com/sander-c-beck/course_advanced_dbt/blob/sander-project-3/tests/generic/assert_valid_string.sql)

## Task 3: Write a unit test to verify the logic of a transformation

## Task 4: Practice writing a more complex unit test, to confirm MRR is calculated correctly

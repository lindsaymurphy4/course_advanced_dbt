## Task 2: Doc Blocks

* Added doc blocks for all columns and tables in the Bingeflix data source. 
* Created a new doc block file for the ads platform.
* Replaced all table and column descriptions in source yml and stg yml with doc block.
    * I did not replace downstream references with doc blocks just to save myself some time. But recognize this is one of the primary benefits of using doc blocks.
    * IRL I would probably identify high priortiy columns based on usage in joins and key metrics and prioritize that way.
